The pyfileindex helps to keep track of files in a specific directory, to monitor added files, modified files and deleted files.

# Installation
The pyfileindex can either be installed via pip using:

    pip install pyfileindex

Or via anaconda from the conda-forge channel

    conda install -c conda-forge pyfileindex


# Usage 
Import pyfileindex:

    from pyfileindex import PyFileIndex 
    pfi = PyFileIndex(path='.')
    
Or you can filter for a specifc file extension: 

    def filter_function(file_name):
        return '.txt' in file_name
        
    pfi = PyFileIndex(path='.', filter_function=filter_function)

List files in the file system index: 

    pfi.dataframe 

Update file system index: 

    pfi.update()
